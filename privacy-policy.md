Privacy Policy
==============

This policy outlines what personal information Otaku Seek ("<b>we</b>", "<b>us</b>", "<b>our</b>") collects in the operation of its services and how that information is handled.

## Information we collect from everyone

Our servers keep standard access logs. These logs contain information such as your IP Address, the "User Agent" sent by your browser, the URL of the page your browser is retrieving from us, the date and time, and referring site.

This information is not tied to accounts or other personal information.

## Information we collect through accounts

We may allow you to register a personal account (a "<b>user account</b>", "<b>user</b>", "<b>account</b>") for use on our service. As part of this we may collect some personal information and tie it to the account you created.

### Nickname

Your account may have a unique nickname tied to it which you specify.

This name is used as part of your interactions with other users on the site and considered public information.

For this reason we recommend that personal information such as a full name is not used when deciding on a nickname.

### Email

Your account may have one or more personal email addresses tied to it.

We may use these emails:

  * to confirm the link between the person that owns the email address and the owner of the user account (email confirmation messages),
  * to unify email/password based accounts with those made through social logins and prevent accidental creation of duplicate accounts,
  * as a method of recovering an account when credentials such as a password or social login is forgotten,
  * to notify you of updates to account information (such as email and password changes) and other account related events, and
  * to notify you of feature updates, messages, or other notifications you may opt-in to.

The exact list of things we use emails for may change over time, but we will never abuse them for the purposes of sending what would be considered spam and we will not sell or share these email addresses with third-parties.
